# Layoffs report
This report provides an overview of the extent to which job layoffs are occurring on a global scale.
### ASK phase
We're analyzing the employee layoffs data with the objective of obtaining valuable insights.
### PREPARE Phase
I am utilizing a dataset that is accessible to the public, which contains up-to-date information on employee layoffs obtained through web scraping of the [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) website. The dataset is currently available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022).
Although layoffs.fyi may not be an official source, it has been cited and featured by reputable sources such as Bloomberg and SFGATE. Therefore, the data obtained from the website can be considered as credible and informative.
### PROCESS Phase
Considering the dataset's relatively small size, I used MS Excel to carry out the data cleaning process. This involved removing any rows that contained null values in the "laid-off-count" column, as well as discarding any unused columns. Additionally, I modified the data type of the Date column to better suit the dataset's requirements.
### ANALYSE and SHARE Phase
It should be noted that the dataset I have utilized for this analysis covers the timeframe from 11 March 2022 to 17 March 2023.
Let's begin by examining the top companies that have carried out the highest number of layoffs.

This stacked column chart displays the top 10 companies that have implemented the highest number of layoffs, with Meta ranking first followed by Amazon and Google. 
It can be seen that a significant proportion of the layoffs happened during the year 2023.


Let's now explore the industry wise distribution of the layoffs. The dataset features a general categorization of industries, with the "Other" category serving as an umbrella term that encompasses various industries such as software and gaming.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the Consumer industry has been significantly impacted by layoffs, followed by the "Other" category and Retail industry. Additionally, the Sales and Healthcare sectors have also experienced a substantial number of layoffs.

By looking at the size of the bubble on map, it is evident that the United States has the highest count of layoffs, followed by India.

### Concluding Remarks:

•	It's important to keep in mind that the layoffs.fyi website may not provide an entirely unbiased representation of employee layoffs worldwide. Depending solely on this website for analysis may lead to inaccuracies and distortions.

•	Since the website and public dataset is updated regularly, the results may change with time.
